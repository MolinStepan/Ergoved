* Status
Work in progress, build at your own risc. Currently only supports arduino nano as controller and XDA keycaps.
[[./docs/img1.png]]
[[./docs/img2.png]]

* Compiling
Install openscad, edit the variables.scad file, compile using
#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
bash ./compile.bash
#+end_src
which takes unreasonably long time to finish (1h+ on my machine), or, if you are brave enough and use openscad unstable
#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
bash ./compile.bash manifold
#+end_src
which is faster, but some errors (e.g. flat artifacts) could happen. I could not replicate in in current verson of project, here is screenshot from development process
[[./docs/manifold-bug.jpg]]

You can also edit files in parts directory, if default configuration does not satisfy your needs.
* TODO
1. Add more controllers
2. Add trackpad support
3. Do actual ergonomics research
4. Find mentioned manifold bug and report it
