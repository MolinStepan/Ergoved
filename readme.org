* Status
Work in progress, build at your own risk. Currently only supports arduino nano or pro micro as controller and XDA keycaps.
* Description
Ergoved is a truly ergonomic parametric easy to build free as in freedom based & redpilled keyboard/pointing device for GNU operating system.

* Compiling
Install openscad, edit the variables.scad file, change ./parts/*-case.scad and ./parts/*-bottom.scad to use your controllers (see ./keyboard/inner-holders.scad and maybe ./keyboard/case-modifications.scad), compile using
#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
bash render.sh
#+end_src
which takes 15 minutes on my machine, or, if you are brave enough and use openscad unstable
#+begin_src bash :tangle yes
bash render.sh manifold
#+end_src
which is faster, but some errors (e.g. flat artifacts) could happen. I could not replicate in in current verson of project, here is screenshot from development process
[[./docs/manifold-bug.jpg]]

You can also edit files in parts directory, if default configuration does not satisfy your needs.
* Todo
1. Add more controllers
2. Add trackpad support
3. Do actual ergonomics research
4. Find mentioned manifold bug and report it
